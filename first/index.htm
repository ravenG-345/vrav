        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h1>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Cute, huh? I been working on this web page for a while now. This is my frst ever web page and I didnt know what to write it about until while brainstorming, I thought this will be the perfect gift. 
        A little over the top but perfect nonetheless. Well, its kind of the same as a letter but the coding effort that came into this is unmatched. So I hope you appeciaate the effort, even if you dont like it. 
        Anyway lets get straight to it.</p>
        <h2>THINGS I LOVE ABOUT YOU IN NO PARTICULAR ORDER</h2>
        <h4>1. YOU LISTEN</h4>
        <p>You are curious about me, you wait to talk and actually take in and digest everything that I say. 
        An underrated aspect, important nonetheless. When we are having a conversation there is never a time that we talk over one another, and I never have to say the same thing twice. You listen and encourage me to be open about my feelings. I think thats a beautiful thing.
        </p>
        <h4>2. YOU ARE THE OTHER HALF OF ME</h4>
        <p>Its very cliche, but sometimes you say something that I was just about to say. And considering that we are both INTJ-As 
        I cant say that I am surprised but it does takes me aback sometimes. Except our similar personalities, we see eye to eye in other aspects of 
        life as well, take religion for example. Its a shame however that I can't say the same about cats. We are going to own a cat though,or two...hopefully. </p> 
        <h4>3. YOU ARE ENDURING And OUTGOING</h4>
	<center><img src="h1.jpg" alt="Picture of a book with a heart" width="400" height="300"></center>
	<p style="text-align: center;">This is to show your dedication to your career</p>
        <p>Samuel L. Jackson as the hitman(don't remember the name) in the Hitman's Bodyguard said it best when he said, 'Life is a highway and it's mighty f*cking long, its full of twists and turns!!!' 
        People describe life in numerous ways, and to some, life is a b*tch with exposed teeth out to getcha! while to others, life has been rather kind and more than generous, and they tend to think life is a valley of lilies and roses. You've been through some hardcore sh*t(I duuno if cursing is allowed...), and you got to the other end without picking up any toxic traits. 
        You are not overly anything; you are the right balance of everything, you are my right balance of everything. 
        You've got most of your life planned out to the Tee(typical INTJ), a true go-getter. I'm honored to be a part of those plans, truly. </p>
        <h4>4. YOU ARE DROP-DEAD  GORGEOUS</h4>
        <center><img src="cute picture.jpg" alt="Picture of  VERY CUTE dude" width="400" height="400"></center>
        <p>I mean look at you. I can't add on that, it honestly speaks for itself, it's just a fact; let's just leave it at that. </p>
        <h3>5. HONESTY</h3>
	<center><img src="honest.png" alt="MIRROR THAT DEPICTS TRASPARENCY" width="400" height="300"></center>
        <p>This is one of my favourite things about you, you say what you think but you still think about what you say before you say it. Its a briliant combination, you do over-explain yourself a lot but you are honest. 
        </p>
        <h3>5. YOU ARE THOUGHTFUL AND SWEET</h3>
        <p>Actually this might be the biggest reason. I love how much you consider me in everything even when you talk, you typically end up over explaining yourself. 	Its second nature, small mercies I guess. Its very kind of you.</p>
	<p>I'm finally done with this HUZZAH!!!</p>
        <center><img src="huz.jpg" alt="Cartoon cheering HUZZAH!!!" width="400" height="300"></center>
	<p>I wasnt going to finish it but then you expressed how much you loved the idea and how much you wanted to read it so, of course I had to finish it for you.</p>
